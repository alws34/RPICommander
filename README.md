# RPICommander

Recently i found myself with 10+ RPIs for various projects and decided to create one tool to rule them all :smiley:

this tool can run commands (via SSH - using the SSH.NET library) automatically on your device/s from a customized list of commands and devices.

features:
* You can easily add and remove commands and devices.
* Send multiple ssh commands to multiple ssh enabled devices. 
* ALL "DB" files are stored in "%programdata%\RPI Commander" and can be edited even on runtime (bear in mind that this will reset all of your selections).

**No Data collected**

done with C# WinForms.

Enjoy!
