# RPICommander

Recently i found myself with 10+ RPIs for various projects and decided to create one tool too rule them all

this tool can run commands automatically on your device/s from a customized list of commands and devices.

*putty must be installed in order to use this tool*

you can download putty from here: https://www.putty.org/

done with C# winforms.

ENJOY!
